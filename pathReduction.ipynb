Going one path and coming back the opposite path is a wasted effort, so let's concise these paths to go the shortest route.\n",

        "You can immediately see that going \"NORTH\" and then \"SOUTH\" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place!\n",

The path becomes [\"EAST\", \"WEST\"], now \"EAST\" and \"WEST\" annihilate each other, therefore, the final result is [] .\n",
        "In [\"NORTH\", \"EAST\", \"WEST\", \"SOUTH\", \"WEST\", \"WEST\"], \"NORTH\" and \"SOUTH\" are not directly opposite but they become directly opposite after the reduction of \"EAST\" and \"WEST\" so the whole path is reducible to [\"WEST\", \"WEST\"].\n",
